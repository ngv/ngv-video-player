h1. NGV HTML Javascript Video Player

h2.  Introduction

This is a simple HTML5 video player with Flash fallback.

h3. Why another HTML5 video player?

No other player available as of Mar 2012 has the following set of features:

* open source
* minimal use of JS (only for simple controls UI)
* flash fallback with any SWF video player using simple <embed> element embedding (eg. for IE 7,8)
* Fullscreen API support on all browsers that provide the feature (including Firefox > 10)
* JS to enhance a native HTML5 video element with JS based controls displayed SEPERATELY (not overlayed) from the video element.

h2. Usage

h3. Dependancies

Depends on jquery and jquery-ui (slider only).
Tested with versions: jquery jquery 1.7.1 and jquery-ui 1.8.17

Tested with JWPlayer 5.3 for Flash fallback in IE only.

The following html structure is required for the external JS-based controls:

bc. <div class="video_controlbar">
<a id="play_pause_video" class="play_button" href="#" >Play</a>
<a id="fullscreen" href="#" >Fullscreen</a>
<div class="video-seek"></div>
<div class="video-timer">00:00</div>
</div>

The div element could be replaced with other elements as long as the class names are retained. This HTML can be placed anywhere within the HTML page containing the @<video>@ element.
